Concurrent Billboard 2 weeks build time did not go well.

Overview of the project was to build a concurrent billboard system in two weeks over the uni break didn't go as planed 
in anyway and only just barrely worked. Due to the work load at the time didn't have time to properly design the system and
as we all know concurrence will get you for that.

i don't think i ever tracked down all the bugs in this project.
